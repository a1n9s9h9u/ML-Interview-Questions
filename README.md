## ML Interview Questions

#### Data Science

Data science is basically a multidisciplinary field that essentially focuses on extracting insights from large data sets – both raw and structured. Data science is always concerned with finding new patterns and insights that were not known. Data scientists collect data from varied sources, organise that information and extract results. But their work doesn’t end here. They also transform the results they get into solutions and communicate the findings to ultimately lead to effective decision making in businesses.

#### Data Analytics

Data analytics comes under the purview of data science. It essentially processes and performs statistical analysis on the existing sets of data. So data analytics is not about finding questions but finding answers and gaining insights for problems that we know. Data analytics, though related to data science, is much limited in its scope and is much more specific. It does not aim to look for connections between the data but ways to support the goal in mind. Precisely, data analytics analyzes raw data to make conclusions about that information.

#### Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence is nothing but the simulation of human intelligence in machines. AI enables machines to think, learn, and find solutions (solve problems) just like human brains do. AI possesses the power to rationalize like us and take actions that are most likely to accomplish a goal. Through artificial intelligence, machines can execute the desired tasks by imitating human intelligence.

#### Machine learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It essentially gives machines the ability to learn and improve through experiences – without the need to program them explicitly. ML aims to develop programs that can access data and utilise it to learn for themselves.

#### There are two types of machine learning:

Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning

In Supervised Learning, the machine learns under supervision. It contains a model that is able to predict with the help of a labeled dataset. A labeled dataset is one where you already know the target answer.

#### Supervised learning can be further divided into two types:

Classification
Regression

Classification is used when the output variable is categorical i.e. with 2 or more classes. For example, yes or no, male or female, true or false, etc.

Regression is used when the output variable is a real or continuous value. In this case, there is a relationship between two or more variables i.e., a change in one variable is associated with a change in the other variable. For example, salary based on work experience or weight based on height, etc.

#### Real-Life Applications of Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is used to assess the risk in financial services or insurance domains in order to minimize the risk portfolio of the companies.

Image classification is one of the key use cases of demonstrating supervised machine learning. For example, Facebook can recognize your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photos.

In Unsupervised Learning, the machine uses unlabeled data and learns on itself without any supervision. The machine tries to find a pattern in the unlabeled data and gives a response.

#### Unsupervised learning can be further grouped into types:

Clustering
Association

Clustering is the method of dividing the objects into clusters that are similar between them and are dissimilar to the objects belonging to another cluster. For example, finding out which customers made similar product purchases.

Suppose a telecom company wants to reduce its customer churn rate by providing personalized call and data plans. The behavior of the customers is studied and the model segments the customers with similar traits. Several strategies are adopted to minimize churn rate and maximize profit through suitable promotions and campaigns.

Association is a rule-based machine learning to discover the probability of the co-occurrence of items in a collection. For example, finding out which products were purchased together.

Let’s say that a customer goes to a supermarket and buys bread, milk, fruits, and wheat. Another customer comes and buys bread, milk, rice, and butter. Now, when another customer comes, it is highly likely that if he buys bread, he will buy milk too. Hence, a relationship is established based on customer behavior and recommendations are made.

#### Real-Life Applications of Unsupervised Learning

Semantically similar words share a similar context. People post their queries on websites in their own ways. Semantic clustering groups all these responses with the same meaning in a cluster to ensure that the customer finds the information they want quickly and easily. It plays an important role in information retrieval, good browsing experience, and comprehension.

Unsupervised machine learning models can be used to identify accident-prone areas and introduce safety measures based on the intensity of those accidents.
